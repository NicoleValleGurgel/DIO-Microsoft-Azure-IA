This is a simple song. Gonna write it for a friend. My shirt is inside. I'm messy with the pen. He made Margaret on a rooftop. She was wearing white and he was like, I might be in trouble. He had flashes of the good life. He was like. Should I jump off this building now or do it on the double? 'Cause baby, if your love is in trouble. Baby, if your love isn't true. Maybe if your love is in trouble. When you know, you know, it kind of makes me laugh, running down the path when you could have spoken. Words on my friends. But they're red flies. They're white eyes. They're black eyes, and they're blue eyes. If you ask yourself, how do you know? And that's your answer. The answer is no. Yeah. No way. Let it go ladies on this baby, if your love is in trouble. When you know, you know. When you know, you know, it kind of makes me laugh. Running my life where your good is going, 'cause when you know, you know, when you're old, you know, like Hollywood in me, the diamond on your ring, the soul that you're painting, the table, one that makes me sick. Hey. When you know. So if you don't know. Don't give up because you never know what the new day might break. Maybe tomorrow you'll know. Maybe tomorrow you'll know. Maybe tomorrow you'll know. I mean join the party, by the way. The party's December 18. Let's watch this out. Because when you know. When you hold your own copy of me, that diamond on your ring, the soul that you bring to the table, one that makes me say. My love you.
